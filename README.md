The habitats of native species of plants are threatened in many areas of the world. Presently, scientists who have been trained in this field visit these locations to better understand the challenges. The use of such professionals is expensive and time-consuming.
The project uses deep learning to identify images of invasive and non-invasive species in Virginia. Our data set consists of 405 images of five types of plants: Duckweed, Watercress, Arrowhead, Grassy Mud Plantain , and Hydrilla . Using deep learning, we achieved an accuracy 96% from Xception on a held-out test set.
Motivation
According to some, Hydrilla poses an ecological threat. It has the ability to grow in various conditions and this gives it an advantage over native plants. Infestations of hydrilla can be harmful to fish populations as well. They can cause oxygen depletion zones which can be harmful to fish.
